# EP_CppForDesktopApp
##### The initials EP in any repository stand for Educational Project. These are course projects and personal experiments for learning.

This application is for the C++ final exam at Quark Academy. 
It is an application made in C++ with WinApi GUI and a little invention I made to manage an in-memory “database”.

To execute the program go to: .\x64\Debug  
To compile the program you should configure your compiler for the C++ version 20
